CL-Workshops 5/17 Spin the Wheels project 1

## Getting Started

## Audio
The file in './js/WordSounds.js' is really not being used by the app.
It is place here to inform:

1. The location of actual sound files
1. That filename of sound file must be the same as that of the image file

For example, cam.png must have a corresponding cam.wav
